-- Trigger configuration. You need to change this to something other than <tab> if you use one of the following:
-- - https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe
-- - https://github.com/nvim-lua/completion-nvim
vim.g.UltiSnipsExpandTrigger = "<tab>"
vim.g.UltiSnipsJumpForwardTrigger = "<c-j>"
vim.g.UltiSnipsJumpBackwardTrigger = "<c-k>"

-- If you want :UltiSnipsEdit to split your window.
vim.g.UltiSnipsEditSplit = "vertical"
